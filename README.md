# AQ-8th-Light

Start the program with node googleBooks.js

## Process and Approach 

I created a develop branch to start this project. You can find the commits there, but It will be merged to main. 
I started off this project by creating subproblems. 

1. I started by figuring out how to get user input and convert it to a useable string
2. Created a basic google books api call with no user input. I wanted to make sure the api call was correct and fullfilled the requirements 
3. Combined both the user input and the api call so that I could make custom api calls
4. Started covering edge cases for both user input and any api calls (400 error, no books found, missing fields)
5. Implemented the add to reading list and view the reading list 
6. Focused on giving user output, letting them know their options and providing feedback based on their input/decisions.
7. Finally, cleaned up code and looked for any edge cases or bad inputs that I may have missed

## Testing 

Unfortunately, I did not include any tests with this iteration. In college, I was never taught how to create tests, and I wasn't sure how to test user
inputs. I figured I could test the api calls. I mainly focused on manual testing and fixing any errors or edges cases through that testing. 
If there are any resources for learning and creating tests that you suggest, please feel free to include them in the feedback!
